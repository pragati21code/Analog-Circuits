# COMMON SOURCE AMPLIFIER  <br>
Gate : Input:  Vsin : Va= 10m <br>
            : frequency = 1k Hz <br>
Drain: output  <br>       
source: Grounded <br>
Supply: 1.8V <br>
Voltage Gain: High, depending on the transconductance <br>
Load resistor: 5K <br>
Phase Shift: The output signal is inverted (180° phase difference from the input).<br>
Input Impedance: High (due to the gate being insulated). <br>
Output Impedance: Moderate. <br>
