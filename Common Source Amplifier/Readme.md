Common Source <br>
##Gate : Input:  Vsin : Va= 10m
            : frequency = 1k Hz
Drain: output         
source: Grounded 
Supply: 1.8V
Voltage Gain: High, depending on the transconductance (
Load resistor: 5K
Phase Shift: The output signal is inverted (180Â° phase difference from the input).
Input Impedance: High (due to the gate being insulated).
Output Impedance: Moderate.
