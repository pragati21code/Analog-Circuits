# Common Source with active load NMOS
Drain of Driver : output <be>

Gain = 0.8
Active Load: The load is an NMOS transistor operating in the saturation region.
Amplifying Transistor: The main NMOS transistor acts as the amplifier.
The output is taken from the drain of the amplifying NMOS.
The circuit exploits the current-voltage characteristics of the load transistor to achieve a higher gain.
